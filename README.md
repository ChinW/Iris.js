**Iris.js** is the implementation of *Iris programming language* using *Javascript* which is aimed at executing Iris scripts or Iris bytecode right on browser environment to provide another more language selection for *web development*.

To use **Iris.js**, you will be able to:
>1. Program in a more object-oriented pattern because *Iris* is **a completely object-oriented programming language just like _Ruby_** and you may experience some convinience which you always need before in you developing.
>2. **Send *Iris bytecode* from server to browser directly and execute it**, which could coordinate with *Encryption and Confusion* to provide a higher security in some applications.
>3. Simply write a game on browser with Iris 2D game engine and furthermore transplant the one to another platform even without any modification of your code because *Iris 2D game engine* can be drived by Iris programming language on every platform it supports.
>4. Be qualified for any requirements that *Javascript* can do, but beyond that you may also experience another web programming feel.
>5. May you find :)
